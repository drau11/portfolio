# 👋 Hi, I'm **Devesh Rana**

I’m a Cyber Security Engineer based in Sydney, Australia, specialising in securing cloud-native environments, uplifting engineering teams, and embedding security within the software development lifecycle.

My work spans cloud security, data protection, application security, external attack surface management, and large-scale vulnerability reduction programs. I enjoy solving real-world security challenges and creating processes that help engineering squads move faster *and* more securely.

I’m passionate about:

- Building scalable vulnerability management workflows  
- Cloud architecture & AWS security  
- Detection engineering & automation  
- Uplifting CI/CD security practices  
- Data security posture management  
- Supporting teams with clear, actionable security guidance  

Outside of work, I spend time sharpening my technical skills — from hands-on offensive security labs to learning new cloud technologies, attending industry events, and contributing to internal security initiatives.

My goal is simple:  
### **To be a security engineer who makes a measurable difference — not just to security posture, but to the people I work with.**
